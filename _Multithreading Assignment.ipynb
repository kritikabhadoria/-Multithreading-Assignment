    "**1. What is multithreading in Python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in Python. Why is the threading module used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is a lightweight process that can run concurrently with other threads within the same process. Multithreading is used to achieve parallelism and improve the efficiency of programs, especially when performing I/O-bound or CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called `threading`. The `threading` module provides a high-level interface for working with threads, allowing developers to create, start, and manage threads easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Write the use of the following functions (activeCount, currentThread, enumerate).**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `activeCount`: This function returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. It is used to determine the number of active threads in a program.\n",
    "- `currentThread`: This function returns the current Thread object representing the caller's thread. It is useful for obtaining information about the currently executing thread.\n",
    "- `enumerate`: This function returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive. It is often used to iterate over all active threads in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Explain the following functions (run, start, join, isAlive).**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `run`: This method is the entry point for the thread's activity. It defines the behavior of the thread when it is started.\n",
    "- `start`: This method starts the execution of the thread by invoking the `run` method. It creates a new thread of execution and calls the `run` method internally.\n",
    "- `join`: This method blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join` method is called completes its execution. It is used to synchronize the execution of multiple threads.\n",
    "- `isAlive`: This method returns a Boolean value indicating whether the thread is alive (i.e., its `run` method has been called and has not yet terminated).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Write a Python program to create two threads. Thread one must print the list of squares and thread two must print the list of cubes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_squares():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Square of {i}: {i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Cube of {i}: {i*i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create threads\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start threads\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for threads to finish\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Threads execution complete.\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "**5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "- Improved performance: Multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks, leading to faster completion of tasks.\n",
    "- Responsiveness: Multithreading enhances the responsiveness of applications by keeping the UI responsive while performing background tasks.\n",
    "- Resource sharing: Threads within the same process share resources, reducing memory overhead compared to multiple processes.\n",
    "- Simplified program structure: Multithreading simplifies the design of concurrent programs compared to multiprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "- Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity due to potential issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "- Synchronization overhead: Threads may need to synchronize access to shared resources, leading to overhead and potential performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "- Debugging challenges: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior and timing issues.\n",
    "- Resource contention: Threads competing for shared resources may lead to contention and reduce overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deadlocks:** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. As a result, none of the threads can progress, leading to a deadlock state where the program remains indefinitely stuck. Deadlocks can occur when threads acquire locks in different orders or when multiple locks are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Race conditions:** A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the timing or interleaving of operations performed by multiple threads. In a race condition, the outcome of the program depends on the relative timing of operations, which may vary each time the program is executed. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or incorrect results. They often occur when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization."
